// Only x hours are left for the March Long Challenge and Chef is only left with the last problem unsolved.
//  However, he is sure that he cannot solve the problem in the remaining time. From experience, he figures out that he needs
//  exactly H hours to solve the problem.
// Now Chef finally decides to use his special power which he has gained through years of intense yoga.
// He can travel back in time when he concentrates. Specifically, his power allows him to travel to N different time zones,
// which are T1,T2,â€¦,TN hours respectively behind his current time.
// Find out whether Chef can use one of the available time zones to solve the problem and submit it before the contest ends.
